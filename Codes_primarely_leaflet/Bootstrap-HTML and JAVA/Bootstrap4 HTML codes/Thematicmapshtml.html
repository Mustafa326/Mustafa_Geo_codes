    						In the map, Grey color area shows absence of data.Red colored Districts contains extremely high number of Covid Cases according to the total number of covid cases by that time. Orange are for high number, yellow for medium, light green for low number of covid cases. While the Dark Green Color in the map indicates zero covid case. This means that these districts were corona free.  Till the end of First wave of Corona virus kohat, bannu, nankana sahab, chitral and most of rural part of Balouchistan.The trend in first two maps that is for March and April, makes it very clear that corona has entered Pakistan mostly through borderline cities. There are absolutely no corona virus or variant cases with Pakistan origin. Extreme number of corona cases can be observed for Karachi, Lahore and Quetta region which are the gateway to enter into Pakistan through Arabian Sea, India and Iran respectively.Another point of exception lies in the twin cities case. It can be observed that Islamabad possessed high number of corona virus cases whereas its adjacent Rawalpindi city has lesser numbers. Islamabad possesses a relatively clean and open environment with less population per square kilometers. On the other hand, Rawalpindi is densely populated and highly congested. Especially in marketplaces in city region, Standard Operating Procedures and social distancing practices cannot be made to follow even if it is to be because of narrow streets and overcrowded business areas. Rawalpindi also possess lower literacy percentage and awareness. Still it had lower number of Covid cases than Islamabad. The reason to this could only be lack of testing or increased exposure to corona virus might had induced herd immunity right from the beginning.
