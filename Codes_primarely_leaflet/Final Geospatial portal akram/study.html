              <p>The word Punjab literally means “five waters” which is referring to Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, which are tributaries of the Indus River. Punjab is situated in the31°N 72°E (latitude and longitude) coordinates.  Punjab is one of the most important province of Pakistan. The total area covered by Punjab is 205,344 km2, its capital is the city of Lahore which is located in the east central region near the border with India.
