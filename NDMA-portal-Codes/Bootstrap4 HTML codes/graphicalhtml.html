    						The comparison graph shows a plot where actual corona graph line and extrapolated regression line on a) linear and b) logarithmic scales. The extrapolated line is the best fit line which is based on linear regression algorithm. The algorithm was trained on basis of data for first wave of COVID pandemic in Pakistan. In the figure b with logarithmic scale, it can be observed that curve of actual covid cases started to flatten after the first wave. The extrapolated line shows that if curve had progressed in the same trend like it was during the month of June (peak of first wave), then the total number of covid cases would have been twenty times more than the total recorded cases on 30th January 2021. There is a small rise in the end of part of actual cases graph line which is due to the second wave of corona virus. However, second wave was not as much trouble some as the first and it can be observed to flatten off as well.
